# Fill In The Brain - General Assembly - SEI Project 2
Fill in the Brain is a web application used to create quiz material in the form of fill-in-the-blank questions from content provided by a user. The objective is to provide users with a way to quickly test their knowledge on content they are trying to learn. This application was created for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immsersive (SEI) Program.

## 1. Project Requirements

As part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Program, students are to create web CRUD application using Node, Express and MongoDB with the following requirements:
  - Have at least 2 data entities, one that represents the main functional idea for the applications and another with a 1-to-many or many-to-many relationship with the main entity.
  - Have Create, Read, Update and Delete operations with the database
  - Be styled in a way that is aligned with the web application's purpose
  - Be able to be deployed online through Heroku

This web application may optionally include the following features:
  - OAuth Authentication
  - Basic Authorization that restricts users from performing CUD operations unless they are logged in and the data is created by them. ```isLoggedIn``` middlware should be used for this feature.
  - Uses a third-party API
  - Exposes its own API where it returns data resources as JSON
